After a difficult fight the two factions couldn'y work together well enough to stay alive.
For one to stay alive they both need to stay alive!
If they could have put their differences aside for a while longer,
they could have survived.
Maybe if they had survived the war could have ended.
But not this time!
Maybe the next ships who get traped will be able to work together and
end this stupid war!
